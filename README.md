# Face_detection_privacy
Face detection is widely used in almost every field. However sometimes it causes privacy issue especially while recording outside, operating video surveillance. Some faces have to be blurred in some documentaries to preserve anonimity. Due to this situation, we have implemented face blurred system using haarcascade and mtcnn method. In that work, all faces will be blurred for a given picture or video. The system can be adjusted to only blur custom faces instead of all faces.
